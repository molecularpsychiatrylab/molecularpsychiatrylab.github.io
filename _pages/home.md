The Molecular Psychiatry research group is located in the Neuroscience Research Laboratory at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS). We are interested in the discovery of novel genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric diseases. We also aim to mechanistically evaluate the genetic risk factors by molecular, cellular, and behavioral phenotyping to characterise molecular pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases for druggable targets and biomarkers.
